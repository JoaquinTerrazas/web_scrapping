"As of January 2024, Guyana has an estimated 11 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, which is 75% of Brazil's reserves. The International Energy Agency predicts that Guyana's daily production could increase fivefold by 2030, from 250,000 barrels in 2022. 

Venezuela has engaged in military build-ups near its border with Guyana, including troop and equipment movements, in a show of force and preparations for potential military conflict over the disputed Essequibo region. While Guyana's government has responded with diplomatic efforts and sought international legal assistance to de-escalate the situation, the two nations have shown they are prepared for conflict, even though no act of aggression has occurred. 

ExxonMobil and its partners have committed nearly $55 billion to the development of six oil projects in Guyana's offshore Stabroek Block, with over $33 billion of this amount having been spent by early 2025. The investments are primarily for exploring and developing the block's substantial oil reserves, with production from the six projects expected to reach over a million barrels of oil per day by 2027. 

Venezuela's Ministry of Defense states it has between 95,000 to 150,000 active combatants in the Venezuelan Armed Forces (FANB), which also includes the National Guard, Navy, and Air Force, alongside a growing National Militia of hundreds of thousands. 

Guyana's military, the Guyana Defence Force (GDF), has approximately 3,400 active-duty personnel, with an additional 670 in the volunteer reserve. 

Venezuela holds the largest proven oil reserves in the world, with approximately 303-304 billion barrels.",789,1n5yfan
"By Suzanne Blake and Gabe Whisnant - Reporter, Consumer & Social Trends: 

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro warned Monday he would ""declare a republic in arms"" if U.S. forces in the Caribbean attacked his country.

""In the face of this maximum military pressure, we have declared maximum preparedness for the defense of Venezuela,"" Maduro said of the deployment, which he characterized as ""an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.""
